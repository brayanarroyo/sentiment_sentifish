HIPPA has to be suspended! South Korea has dealt with this COVID-19 extremely well because they have been totally transparent with their people about where the people with the COVID-19 are and where they have been. We cannot do that because of HIPPA. A man who is positive for the COVID-19 came out of a surrounding county of Austin Texas but official will not say exactly where or even the county he came from. This is likely due to HIPPA The rumor mill runs rampant with no information. We need to know and HIPPA has to go!,

"With the confusion on where the COVID-19 began, who patient zero is, whether it originated in China or our military as a weapon as China claims, and the fact that many people (including our family) went through mild to horrible colds and flus last Nov/Dec when international travel was wide open...I�d like to ask officials, what evidence is there to prove that it hasn�t been here all along as a naturally mutated COVID-19 since November? Have you exhumed any bodies for testing?Tens of thousands have died from the flu in our country alone from November up until the COVID-19 was discovered, which is normal, and it�s all people who are vulnerable to any type of illness who unfortunately perishes. Could it be another form of the flu that is very mild compared to others since there are different strains of the flu COVID-19? I haven�t seen this answered yet.",
Allowing Wal-Mart and other 24 hour stores to limit their hours is going to concentrate people together and promote the spread of this COVID-19.

"Someone in charge needs to see the below post from a patient in NY, Matthew Kabel. This needs to be addressed.I feel like I need to share what I've dealt with the last 14 days so everyone can understand why things are getting worse with COVID-19, something I may or may not have been battling for two weeks. I'll never know, and at this point I don't believe it matters anymore.Two weeks ago today I came down sick, for the next three days I had a low-grade fever (~100.6), dry cough and shortness of breath.No other symptOMS, which is exactly how COVID has been defined. I went to my Brooklyn doctor last Tuesday, and while in the waiting room I could hear the Nurse Practitioner saying how stupid the overreaction to COVID is. My doctor told me it probably wasn't COVID and sent me home on Tamiflu without actually testing me for the flu. Looking back, they totally blew me off and am sure others too. Strike one.I took Tamiflu for the 5 days and the fever went away, but my cough and shortness of breath persisted. We celebrated Thomas' Confirmation last Saturday under the assumption I had the flu but had finished the Tamiflu so was no longer contagious. By Monday I was consistently out of breath so was afraid my flu had transitioned to pneumonia. On Monday I went to the ER where both flu (via nasal swab) and pneumonia (xray) were RULED OUT. They took cultures (now known to be negative) and the doctor who had grown suddenly serious told me it ""may or may not be COVID-19"" but she could not test me as I was under 50 and had no known contact with somebody who either had it or left the country (yet I ride a filthy packed subway daily!). They had to save tests for those in distress who met criteria, her hands were tied.She weighed admitting me into isolation, but after discussing our medical experience with Sally and seeing that my bloodwork actually looked good we decided that I should go straight home and self quarantine on home treatment, which I did. However, she never did a Respiratory Viral Panel to rule out anything else, which looking back was a big mistake. Strike two.I stayed home in quarantine on treatment (steroids, 2 nebulizers, inhaler). We already know how to quarantine and be sanitary, this is the way we lived so much with Sally. The doctor said Nicole and the boys did not have to quarantine, just me. By Thursday we were anxious because the COVID fears got intense and people who knew I had been sick started asking about me, especially at William's school. Plus my breathing had not improved, which I never have respiratory issues. I worked with a politician friend to get into another ER to get a fresh set of eyes on me and have a full respiratory panel done so we could see if I had something else due to process of elimination to blame this on.Thursday was my 3rd MD visit and second hospital ER trip (different hospital). The doctor confirmed I was still wheezing despite 4 days of treatment (xray negative again) but again said he couldn't test me for COVID. He said, ""They were supposed to release a bunch of new tests to us but never did."" He said he was doing a full respiratory panel with a nasal swab so we could try to confirm something other than COVID, it'd test me for flu + at least 5 other things. My 2 hours in the ER on Thursday changed my perspective on everything...for the worse. It was overcrowded and they were grouping sick people with patients who were there with sprained wrists and the like. The guy next to me had flu confirmed while the woman across had back pain. There were a lot of people hacking, only half were wearing masks, and knew most would not actually be tested for COVID. Plus, the bathroom was filthy both times I used them so the cleaning crew could not keep up. I've spent enough time in hospitals to realize how very bad this was, the medical staff was exhausted and overwhelmed, COVID plus flu and everything else was going to spread fast, and and I wanted out of there. Finally the doctor sent me home to await results but said to quarantine for 14 days. When I told him I already was and asked from what period that should start, he looked at me exhausted and said, ""14 days, that's all they're saying. It's all made up, it doesn't really mean anything because they don't know."" That told me this was not under control.That night, I get a call from the covering doctor who said my flu and RSV tests were negative. I say ""OK, but what about the other 4-5 COVID-19es they tested for?"" Doctor said that's it, no other tests were ordered.They screwed up my tests. Strike three. All attempts to figure this out failed and I couldn't get the one test I actually needed. Last night I started to feel better and today I feel almost myself again outside of a nagging cough. It's been two weeks and nobody I've had contact with prior or during has been sick so have to believe I'm in the clear. I keep reading different opinions on how long it lives inside somebody, what I've realized is they have no idea. This could have been in the USA for weeks/months without them knowing. At this point it is what it is.I'm not here to point fingers, this was a failure on so many levels and there will be time for that later. For now, I hope everyone takes good care of themselves.I leave you with selfies from my three doctor visits. And I spent my birthday in isolation, so when this is over you better believe I'm doing a redo!",

"After listening to President and his Administration's convoluted timeline of what they knew and when they knew it one can only surmise that the delay in testing as well as in the procurement of ventilators and respirators was an attempt by President and his cronies to monetize the deaths (murders) of Americans to line their own pockets... If so, hopefully patriotic Americans throughout the business and financial industries will have photocopied and recorded all that pertains so that eventually justice will prevail.",

The HIPAA rules need to be relaxed during this crisis. Nursing homes cannot send pictures of loved ones that you can't get in to check on. I asked for a picture of him and his injury to be texted to me so I could see his injury and see how he is fairing as I was told he is not eating good which he always has. He cannot communicate on the phone and cannot take care of himself and I can't get to him and they tell me HIPAA prevents them from sending me a picture. This needs to change.,

"I had an idea to safely get our country back on track quicker amid Covid-19. What if we attempted to create herd immunity by letting the COVID-19 spread among healthy 20-year-olds who are no longer living with their parents up to 35-year-olds, let them return to work and normal life while everyone still living with at risk individuals and anyone over the age of 35 remains in quarantine. That allows people to be exposed to the COVID-19 without risking overwhelming the hospitals, and then after three weeks, allow healthy 35-45 year olds return to regular life and repeat. This would lessen the impact on our hospitals and by the time 60 year olds are released from quarantine we may have created enough herd immunity in a large enough segment of the population to buffer the effect on those most at risk. Thoughts?",

"U.S. Department of Health and Human ServicesGarlic can kill the new CoronaCOVID-19 (COVID-19)Killing the COVID-19 is easier than killing the bacteria. Garlic can kill bacteria. Therefore, garlic can definitely kill the COVID-19.What's the difference between a bacterial infection and a viral infection?BacteriaBacteria are single-celled microorganisms that thrive in many different types of environments. Some varieties live in extremes of cold or heat. Others make their home in people's intestines, where they help digest food. Most bacteria cause no harm to people, but there are exceptions.COVID-19esCOVID-19es are even smaller than bacteria and require living hosts � such as people, plants or animals � to multiply. Otherwise, they can't survive. When a COVID-19 enters your body, it invades some of your cells and takes over the cell machinery, redirecting it to produce the COVID-19.Allium Sativum (Allicin, Garlic, Garlic Extract)Studies reveal that garlic (it was later discovered that the compound Allicin that was largely responsible) is antibacterial, first noted in a study by Louis Pasteur in 1858, and Allicin is the substance in garlic which is responsible for the typical order. But there are dozens of compounds now known to be naturally inherent in garlic and some of which have certain medicinal value, including 33 sulfur compounds, 17 amino acids, germanium, calcium, copper, iron, potassium, magnesium, selenium, zinc, and vitamins A, B1 and C. Over the past 20 years, over 1,000 scientific publications have reported that garlic has demonstrated antibacterial, antifungal, antitumor, hypoglycemic, hypolipidemic and anti-atherosclerotic activities in both animals and humans. Garlic, when aged and powdered, can inhibit breast tumors in animals. Garlic contains 2 known anti-cancer compounds, selenium and germanium. Garlic has proven capable of reducing cholesterol and triglyceride levels even on unrestricted diets, while increasing HDL cholesterol (the good cholesterol) levels, and aids in the regulation of blood sugar levels.Garlic is thought effective in reducing blood pressure as well. Ajoene, a compound isolated from garlic in 1984, was found to demonstrate anti-thrombotic activity (preventing blood platelet aggregation or clotting of blood) or blood thinning activity, apparently by inhibiting exposure of fibrinogen receptors on platelet membranes. It was determined that ajoene is at least as potent as aspirin in this regard, and thus garlic appears to have some utility and value as a protective agent in atherosclerosis, COVID-19ry thrombosis and stroke. Garlic was also effective in increasing the natural killer-cell activity in AIDS patients, as well as improving other AIDS-related conditions including diarrhea, genital herpes, candidiasis and pansinusitis with recurrent fever.",

"All those who were rightly disposed for everlasting life became believers.?�Acts 13:48.If we are patient with people in the ministry, we will not expect them to understand or accept Bible truth the first time they hear it. As an example, consider how we might reason with someone about the hope of everlasting life on a paradise earth. Many believe that death is the end of it all or that all good people go to heaven. One brother relates an approach that he finds effective. First, he reads Genesis 1:28(Further, God blessed them, and God said to them: �Be fruitful and become many, fill the earth and subdue it, and have in subjection the fish of the sea and the flying creatures of the heavens and every living creature that is moving on the earth.�). Then, he asks the householder where and in what conditions God wanted the human family to live. Most people answer, �On earth, in good conditions.� Next, the brother reads Isaiah 55:11(So my word that goes out of my mouth will be. It will not return to me without results, But it will certainly accomplish whatever is my delight, And it will have sure success in what I send it to do.)and asks whether God�s purpose has changed. Often, the householder will answer no. Finally, the brother reads Psalm 37:10, 11(Just a little while longer, and the wicked will be no more; You will look at where they were, And they will not be there.11But the meek will possess the earth, And they will find exquisite delight in the abundance of peace.) and asks what mankind�s future will be like. Using this Scriptural reasoning, he has helped a number of people to understand that God still wants good people to live forever in Paradise on earth. w19.03 24 �14-15; 25 �19",

"My Friend work in Long Island Hospital Here is his heart broken message to CDC Please act NOW ??CDC recommending hospital staff use bandanas when masks run out. Hospitals are asking the public to sew masks. Here is a physician responding: Please don't tell me that in the richest country in the world in the 21st century, I'm supposed to work in a fictionalized Soviet-era disaster zone and fashion my own face mask out of cloth because other Americans hoard supplies for personal use and so-called leaders sit around in meetings hearing themselves talk. I ran to a bedside the other day to intubate a crashing, likely COVID, patient. Two respiratory therapists and two nurses were already at the bedside. That's 5 N95s masks, 5 gowns, 5 face shields and 10 gloves for one patient at one time. I saw probably 15-20 patients that shift, if we are going to start rationing supplies, what percentage should I wear precautions for?Make no mistake, the CDC is loosening these guidelines because our country is not prepared. Loosening guidelines increases healthcare workers' risk but the decision is done to allow us to keep working, not to keep us safe. It is done for the public benefit - so I can continue to work no matter the personal cost to me or my family (and my healthcare family). Sending healthcare workers to the front line asking them to cover their face with a bandana is akin to sending a soldier to the front line in a t-shirt and flip flops.I don't want talk. I don't want assurances. I want action. I want boxes of N95s piling up, donated from the people who hoarded them. I want non-clinical administrators in the hospital lining up in the ER asking if they can stock shelves to make sure that when I need to rush into a room, the drawer of PPE equipment I open isn't empty. I want them showing up in the ER asking ""how can I help"" instead of offering shallow ""plans"" conceived by someone who has spent far too long in an ivory tower and not long enough in the trenches. Maybe they should actually step foot in the trenches.I want billion-dollar companies like 3M halting all production of any product that isn't PPE to focus on PPE manufacturing. I want a company like Amazon, with its logistics mastery (it can drop a package to your door less than 24 hours after ordering it), halting its 2-day delivery of 12 reams of toilet paper to whoever is willing to pay the most in order to help get the available PPE supply distributed fast and efficiently in a manner that gets the necessary materials to my brothers and sisters in arms who need them.I want Proctor and Gamble, and the makers of other soaps and detergents, stepping up too. We need detergent to clean scrubs, hospital linens and gowns. We need disinfecting wipes to clean desk and computer surfaces. What about plastics manufacturers? Plastic gowns aren't some high-tech device, they are long shirts/smocks...made out of plastic. Get on it. Face shields are just clear plastic. Nitrile gloves? Yeah, they are pretty much just gloves...made from something that isn't apparently Latex. Let's go. Money talks in this country. Executive millionaires, why don't you spend a few bucks to buy back some of these masks from the hoarders, and drop them off at the nearest hospital.I love biotechnology and research but we need to divert viral culture media for COVID testing and research. We need biotechnology manufacturing ready and able to ramp up if and when treatments or vaccines are developed. Our Botox supply isn't critical, but our antibiotic supply is. We need to be able to make more plastic ET tubes, not more silicon breast implants.Let's see all that. Then we can all talk about how we played our part in this fight. Netflix and chill is not enough while my family, friends and colleagues are out there fighting. Our country won two world wars because the entire country mobilized. We out-produced and we out-manufactured while our soldiers out-fought the enemy. We need to do that again because make no mistake, we are at war, healthcare workers are your soldiers, and the war has just begun.God Bless",

"It has come to my attention that despite Governor Hogan's recent ""Stay Home"" Executive Order, the leadership of the Prince George's Public Schools is moving forward with a plan that needlessly exposes citizens of Prince George's County and Maryland. The plan in question involves the issuance of Chromebooks to students that claim no access to technology. This plan comes after two weeks of school closure. The plan calls for three to five PGCPS employees at each school to be responsible for contact with parents to get the devices distributed. The distribution is to take place outside of the schools in a type of curbside issuance. There are major concerns with this threatening and dangerous plan.PGCPS could use its own television network to deliver curriculum or enrichment programs. Since we are quite sure each student has at least one television, there would be no need to leave the home. Programs could be done a couple of hours each day for particular grade levels.PGCPS should have initiated any device issuance plan during the first two weeks of Maryland school closures.PGCPS should have done any issuance through a centralized distribution point, rather than planning to open up all schools, to place more citizens at risk.PGCPS failed to have any contingency curriculum program available.PGCPS is using this planned issuance on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, as a ploy to maintain an image of working for the children.PGCPS is taking out of circulation, thousands of masks and gloves that could be used for emergency workers across the nation.PGCPS clearly violates the Governor's Order for all non-essential or non-emergency movement to cease. We are calling upon Governor Hogan to immediately order the leadership of Prince George's County Public Schools to discontinue this dangerous plan that could potentially expose many to the deadly Corona COVID-19.",

"Numbers 21:5-9 Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition (RSVCE)And the people spoke against God and against Moses, �Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no food and no water, and we loathe this worthless food.� Then the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people, so that many people of Israel died. And the people came to Moses, and said, �We have sinned, for we have spoken against the Lord and against you; pray to the Lord, that he take away the serpents from us.� So Moses prayed for the people. And the Lord said to Moses, �Make a fiery serpent, and set it on a pole; and every one who is bitten, when he sees it, shall live.� So Moses made a bronze serpent, and set it on a pole; and if a serpent bit any man, he would look at the bronze serpent and live.John 3:14-18 Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition (RSVCE)And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of man be lifted up, that whoever believes in him may have eternal life.�For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.

PEOPLE ARE DYING.A senior military general says the Pentagon has not yet delivered any of the 2,000 ventilators it offered to the Department of Health and Human Services two weeks ago because HHS has asked it to wait while the agency determines where the devices should go.Lt. Gen. Giovanni Tuck, the Pentagon�s top logistics official, said in an interview with a small group of reporters Tuesday that the military arranged for an initial batch of 1,000 ventilators to be delivered, but HHS asked it to wait.Tuck also told reporters that of the 5 million respirator masks the Defense Department offered to provide to HHS as personal protective equipment for health care workers and others, about 1.5 million have been sent. He said another 500,000 are due to be shipped this week. The rest will be delivered when HHS asks for them, he added.",

"The process of conversion and repentance was described by Jesus in the parable of the prodigal son, the center of which is the merciful father: the fascination of illusory freedom, the abandonment of the father's house; the extreme misery in which the son finds himself after squandering his fortune; his deep humiliation at finding himself obliged to feed swine, and still worse, at wanting to feed on the husks the pigs ate; his reflection on all he has lost; his repentant and decision to declare himself guilty before his father; the journey back; the father's generous welcome; the father's joy - all these are characteristic of the process of conversion. The beautiful robe, the ring, and the festive banquet are symbols of that new life - pure worthy, and joyful - of anyone who returns to God and to the bosom of his family, which is the Church.

"Kushner says the strategic National Stockpile of lifesaving medical equipment and supplies is ""supposed to be OUR stockpile . . . It�s not supposed to be states� stockpiles that they then use.� So HHS then changes its website to conform to Kushner's statment? Ridiculous!",

Hmhh,
An official government website said Jared Kushner was wrong about the purpose of the Strategic National Stockpile.So it appears the site had to be changed to make the president's son-in-law right.,
"Here's what the official site describing the Strategic National Stockpile said as of last Thursday night: ""Strategic National Stockpile is the nation's largest supply of life-saving pharmaceuticals and medical supplies for use in a public health emergency severe enough to cause local supplies to run out. When state, local, tribal, and territorial responders request federal assistance to support their response efforts, the stockpile ensures that the right medicines and supplies get to those who need them most during an emergency. Organized for scalable response to a variety of public health threats, this repository contains enough supplies to respond to multiple large-scale emergencies simultaneously.""And here's what it was changed to say Friday morning:""The Strategic National Stockpile's role is to supplement state and local supplies during public health emergencies. Many states have products stockpiled, as well. The supplies, medicines, and devices for life-saving care contained in the stockpile can be used as a short-term stopgap buffer when the immediate supply of adequate amounts of these materials may not be immediately available.""Reality said Jared Kushner was wrong, so it appears reality had to be changed to make the president's son-in-law right.",

Is this how we treat the underpriveleged here in the US by making them walking targets and carriers of Covid-19?

It's hard to get away from it on the internet but you'd never know it was there aside from the news on television,
"The original description of the stockpile on the Public Health Emergency subsection of the Health and Human Services site characterized it as �the nation�s largest supply of life-saving pharmaceuticals and medical supplies for use in a public health emergency severe enough to cause local supplies to run out.�It added: �When state, local, tribal, and territorial responders request federal assistance to support their response efforts, the stockpile ensures that the right medicines and supplies get to those who need them most during an emergency.�The new language, published as of Friday morning, describes it as a �short-term stopgap� and emphasized state�s stores of supplies. It was changed to bolster Wonder Boy Jared statement.. It is still the taxpayers money used to pay for this. ????�Many states have products stockpiled, as well,� it now reads. �The supplies, medicines, and devices for life-saving care contained in the stockpile can be used as a short-term stopgap buffer when the immediate supply of adequate amounts of these materials may not be immediately available.�",

It is necessary in some relatively safe way to collect it, kill it and introduce it into yourself.An option is to use an aerosol-containing respirator, but not enough to hold off a COVID-19 that is separate from the water.We breathe through a respirator - we collect the infected aerosol in it, then we heat this respirator to the inactivation temperature of the COVID-19 for the time necessary to evaporate the moisture.Then again we breathe inactivated COVID-19 already slipping through the filter, thus vaccinating itself.",

"CONSIDER MY REAL SUGGESTION FOR A SOLUTION TO COVID:Let's open up the economy, for people that want to work!!Make it mandatory that people that want to work sign a waiver that states they forgo the ability to receive Corona related medical treatment if they contract the COVID-19.Healthcare workers should not have to subject themself to the very real possibility that they themselves contract the COVID-19 from people that willingly subjected themselves to it.Lastly, make it so that in jobs where people have the ability to work from home, their employers cannot penalize their workers if they exercise their right to work from home.This will separate the real from the fake, those that are out protesting for attention and those that are serious about exercising their civil liberties and making a living. What is wrong with that?Otherwise forcing people to go to work during what the president rightfully called a �plague� when there is the option to work from home would be doing the very thing the anti-stay-at-home protestors are protesting, it is violating the civil liberties of those that want to work from home.IRONING OUT SOME KINKS: Nonessential workers can continue to receive support until it becomes safer or phases progress and or work as an essential worker. They can also do house visits if a patron wants to take that risk. Restaurants are open and they can do 'takeout only' until there is a readily available vaccine, which means they can still run their business. Restaurant workers are considered essential workers. This continues until there is a vaccine readily available. There will always be the option of becoming an essential work if you want to work, you would then still have medical coverage against COVID-19. Surely, there can be the support of income in some facet for those working newly found essential jobs to help balance what they once made or to help cover bills. This would be a great phase 1. A way of hopping out and pushing the truck to gain momentum. The next step would be to get it to a mechanic (mass production of a vaccine).It is a human right to protect yourself against weapons. By signing that waiver, a person effectively turned themselves into a potential biological weapon. And health care workers should be able to sign something that will allow them to work on covid patients, however, there should be hospitals for those doctors and the covid patients that signed the waiver.This seems to be a phased symbiotic solution where all parties involved are less fearful and more productive than before. Protection from a pandemic, much like protection from crime, the economy or fire is a public good, therefore, the government and states should treat it as such.",

"This country's greatness was due in large part because of the willingness of our leaders in every field to serve when called.The most important of those leaders and experts were called upon to serve as the president's cabinet members. They served as Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary of Health and Human Services, etc. Their expertise enabled every president to rely on them to help the Nation get through any crisis, especially the ones under the mandate of their department.In this time of crisis, that would be the Secretary of Health and Human Services who is over for the FDA, the CDC, the NIAID and any other agencies charged with the health of this Nation.Strange, then, that not once has the Secretary of Health and Human Services ever attended one of the CoronaCOVID-19 briefings. Isn't it strange, that the expert picked by this president to be his principal officer responsible for the health of the Nation is invisible.Where is he? Why isn't he leading his department in the fight against the most serious health crisis in this Nation's hstory?DON'T YOU WANT TO KNOW?",

"8 WAYS HOW YOU CAN REMAIN PRODUCTIVE WORKING FROM HOME DURING COVID19 PANDEMIC !As the fight against the novel covid-19, countries and organizations are putting up measures to minimize interactions among individuals and colleagues. These measures are ranging from total lockdowns, partial lockdowns, or enforcing the use of protective equipment such as face masks and gloves. As a response to these restrictions, companies, organizations, and government agencies have resorted to working from home for those tasks that can still be done without the physical access of the office.Different individuals are coping up with this new arrangement in different ways, others finding it hard for different reasons while some are managing without many challenges. I was chatting with a friend a couple of weeks ago, and he shared a number of points on coping up with home office which I found them beneficial and thought I could share with you as well. Here are some tips that would help you maintain productivity even when not physically accessing the office...

"Matthew 6 Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition (RSVCE)Concerning Almsgiving6 �Beware of practicing your piety before men in order to be seen by them; for then you will have no reward from your Father who is in heaven.2 �Thus, when you give alms, sound no trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may be praised by men. Truly, I say to you, they have their reward. 3 But when you give alms, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, 4 so that your alms may be in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.Concerning Prayer5 �And when you pray, you must not be like the hypocrites; for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners, that they may be seen by men. Truly, I say to you, they have their reward. 6 But when you pray, go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.[a]7 �And in praying do not heap up empty phrases as the Gentiles do; for they think that they will be heard for their many words. 8 Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him. 9 Pray then like this:Our Father who art in heaven,Hallowed be thy name.10 Thy kingdom come,Thy will be done, On earth as it is in heaven.11 Give us this day our daily bread;[b]12 And forgive us our debts, As we also have forgiven our debtors;13 And lead us not into temptation, But deliver us from evil.[c]14 For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father also will forgive you; 15 but if you do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.Concerning Fasting16 �And when you fast, do not look dismal, like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces that their fasting may be seen by men. Truly, I say to you, they have their reward. 17 But when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face, 18 that your fasting may not be seen by men but by your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.Concerning Treasures19 �Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust[d] consume and where thieves break in and steal, 20 but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust[e] consumes and where thieves do not break in and steal. 21 For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.The Sound Eye22 �The eye is the lamp of the body. So, if your eye is sound, your whole body will be full of light; 23 but if your eye is not sound, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!Serving Two Masters24 �No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.[f]Do Not Worry25 �Therefore I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you shall eat or what you shall drink, nor about your body, what you shall put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing? 26 Look at the birds of the air: they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they? 27 And which of you by being anxious can add one cubit to his span of life?[g] 28 And why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they neither toil nor spin; 29 yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. 30 But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you, O men of little faith? 31 Therefore do not be anxious, saying, �What shall we eat?� or �What shall we drink?� or �What shall we wear?� 32 For the Gentiles seek all these things; and your heavenly Father knows that you need them all. 33 But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things shall be yours as well.34 �Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Let the day�s own trouble be sufficient for the day.",

China is hiding this information ... how to explain that countries, such as France, the United States, Italy, Spain, that were not surprised by the COVID-19COVID-19 already have a much higher death toll than China... I do not believe in the death toll shown by China ... what about you? Some videos have leaked from China's censorship and show hospital corridors crowded with patients ... Oh, my God! How naive we were to believe this ... Look the numbers from China in April 23, 2020: Total cases: 82.804; Deaths: 4.632; New cases: 6. If we compare with worldwide numbers, how can this happen? How can we believe it? Did China discover a vaccine? A drug? An antidote? What is its secret for such low numbers? Why do not they share with the world?

If a person has already had the COVID-19 and got over it then they would be negative, but if they have the antibodies then they could be added to the number of persons who have already had it.

"Here in this sector of Puerto Rico where I live, specifically, Rio Piedras, next to the housing complex called Lopez Sicardo, where there is no law and order and much less concern about COVID-19. Here social distancing and quarantines are a joke. Since about 3:oop.m today and yesterday too the people in Lopez Sicardo have been partying up a storm and they are still at it even though it is past10{00p.m. and the lockdown or quarantine is supposed to start at 9:00pm. These people totally ignore the COVID-19 directives, even though they are right besides a residential facility for the elderly; many of us have underlying medical conditions, like diabetes and cardiovascular disease which make us more vulnerable to COVID-19. These people and the police whom I have called several times could care less. And I was to be treated with annoyance and rudeness for having bothered them. Our governor, Wanda Vazquez mostly shines by her absence having shut down gubernamental offices, including her own, La Fortaleza, except for showing up for a few opportune photo ops and to defend herself against even more accusations of fraud, now mostly related to COVID-19, which become more believable to me given the experiences that I myself am having right now. which I have just described.",
"I HAVE BEEN ASKING SINCE JANUARY. Since it has been stated the CoronaCOVID-19 is detected and fecal samples from infected people, why don't they test wastewater for the COVID-19COVID-19 RNA in the same way? Can't people see, that buy quantifing the amount detected they can determine if entire populations are increasing in infection rate or decreasing in infections? You don't have to test every single person, you can test the collected wastewater, determine the level of the RNA present, and relate the amount detected to the level of infection for the entire served population. With testing being so difficult for individuals,for some reason in this country, why not more quickly move two testing collective properties of entire communities, like wastewater, for the COVID-19 as a determinant of decreasing levels of infection and re-infection? It would hardly cost anything to do this. A little bit of research for trials of methods, stability of the RNA, select the best way to represent the quantity detected, and you're Off to the races......... WHY? Also, the same principle would apply to air sampling and perhaps crowded areas that may begin to emerge as the shutdown ends. Air filters could be placed in strategic locations, run a known amount of air through them, a test for the COVID-19COVID-19 RNA could be done with the filters with the amount detected related to an increase or decrease in the number of infected individuals that were in the area. Could be used for train stations subways buses. Why won't anyone think of testing general environment instead of specific individuals? Where do I post this to get it read or answered? Nobody listens. The tests are very sensitive for this RNA and it would work.",

"Patrice LaBelle MDSun 5/10/2020 As COVID-19 lockdowns are lifted, we immediately institute a schedule of weekly random antigen and antibody testing all over the country with a greater level of testing in specific areas with demographics that make spread more likely (communities with crowding, for example). This will pick up outbreaks of cluster or community spread early, weeks before cases are sick enough to require medical attention. That early identification will allow precisely targeted testing and mitigation measures to be taken. This could avoid the need to reinstitute widespread lockdowns. It would allow communities to remain open, improving the economic situation, boosting morale and avoiding overtaxing govermental and medical systems. This random testing needs to continue until 70 to 80% of the population has been vaccinated.When vaccines become available they should first go to law enforcement, military and healthcare personnel. Then to essential workers in food and medical supply and transportation. Then to other essential workers. Then to care facility residents, school children and prisons. Then, finally, to the general population.",

COMMON HABITS YOU DIDN'T KNOW CAN LOWER YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM - COVID-19 PREPARATION! Body immune system is our main defence against foreign organisms and germs. Our immune system is made up of lymphocytes that engulf germs and COVID-19es when they enter our blood ensuring that our bodies are healthy and productive at all times. But humans have found a way to compromise and destroy this defence system unknowingly or carelessly leaving our body prone and vulnerable to COVID-19es and germs that cause various diseases that may lead to death. In this article we will look into common habits and behaviours that can be hurting our immune system.
